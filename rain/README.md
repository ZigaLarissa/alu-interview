This directory contains two files:

##1. `0-rain.py`: 
This file contains the implementation of a Python function `rain(walls)` that calculates the total amount of rainwater retained given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls. The function calculates the amount of water retained by considering the maximum heights of walls to the left and right of each wall.

##2. `0_main.py`: 
This file provides examples of how to use the `rain()` function by calling it with different input lists and printing the output.

Please refer to the individual files for more information and usage details.

Feel free to explore and utilize the code for your rainwater retention calculations. If you have any questions or suggestions, please let us know.

Thank you!
